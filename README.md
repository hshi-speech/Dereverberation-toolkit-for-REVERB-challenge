Deep Learning Based Monaural Speech Dereverberation Models: Hope We Can Get Better Performance of Dereverberation! 

## What is it for? 
### It is just an idea to make 'an open source tool for the REVERB CHALLANGE dataset'. And I will do it on both time-domain and frequency-domain. 

## The first network models contain (but noy just):

# Frequency-domain
* DNN (Frames-level)
* LSTM (Frames-level, utterance-level)
* CNN (Frames-level, utterance-level, picture)
* U-net

# Time-domain
* SEGAN
* FCN


'I will do ti in a few years, but it does not work now!!!'

I will release the first egs in this month! If everything goes well!
